# Results — browser-big-fast lab

The one comparison table, plus the raw run log it distills from. Process notes live in `plan/`; this file is the deliverable.

## Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| GPU / backend | Apple **Metal-3** WebGPU (adapter vendor `apple`), `shader-f16` supported |
| WebGPU limits | `maxBufferSize` & `maxStorageBufferBindingSize` ≈ **4 GB** (4294967292 B) — the hard single-buffer ceiling |
| Renderer memory | `jsHeapSizeLimit` = 4 GB; holds **4.33 GB cumulative** ArrayBuffers + 1.5 GB single fine; single **≥2 GB** alloc hard-`RangeError`s (V8 2³¹ cap) |
| Runtime | transformers.js `@huggingface/transformers@4` (bundled ORT-web), CDN ESM |
| Harness | `web/run-one.html` (one model / one page-load), static server `:8131`. Verified in the Claude preview chromium (real Metal-3, not SwiftShader). |
| Measurement caveats | absolute tok/s drifts down over a long GPU session → measure per fresh page-load; cold-load includes HF download + shader compile |

## ⚠ The loading wall (central obstacle) — transformers.js path caps at <2 GB

Qwen3-1.7B q4f16 = a **1.33 GB single embedded `.onnx`** (no external-data chunks; every 1.7B variant is ≥1.33 GB). Loading it via the transformers.js pipeline → **`std::bad_alloc` at session creation**, even as the first model in a fresh renderer. Not a missing file, not accumulated memory, not the GPU (~4 GB buffers free), not the renderer (holds 4 GB+). It's a **C++ `std::bad_alloc` inside the ORT-web wasm heap**: the off-the-shelf pipeline loads embedded weights *through* wasm, and the load+working-set crosses a ~2 GB wasm allocation limit between 0.6B (~0.4 GB ✅) and 1.7B (1.33 GB ❌).

**Implication:** the transformers.js-pipeline harness is fine for the ≤1B rung but **cannot reach 1.7B+ — nor any of T1/T2/T3's 5–6 GB models.** The proven route past this is the **raw ORT-web external-data → GPU load path** (weights stream into GPU buffers, bypassing the wasm heap), which is how indira ran 5.3 GB and kohra ran 3 GB in-browser. Building/porting that loader is the next keystone. (A newer ORT-web build with a larger wasm `MAXIMUM_MEMORY` — the handoff's T0 lever — may also lift the embedded-path cap; the external-data route is the safer bet.)

## T0 — q4 on WebGPU (keystone): **WORKS** ✅

**Verdict:** off-the-shelf onnx-community q4 (`q4f16`, dense `MatMulNBits`) computes **correctly** on this Apple Metal-3 GPU via transformers.js@4. kohra's own earlier q4 export miscomputed here (wrong argmax) — that was a **kohra-export-recipe bug, not a platform wall**. The handoff's pessimistic premise ("q4 broken ⇒ fp16 ceiling") does **not** bind on the onnx-community path. Hand-rolled exports must match that recipe (symmetric where ORT-web requires it). Full logit-diff-vs-CPU harness deferred (only needed to debug a specific bad export).

## Comparison table (end-of-lab target)

Filling incrementally. `—` = not yet measured. TTFT marked ⚠ until the prompt-put probe bug is fixed.

¹ JS-heap only (`performance.memory`), **not** GPU memory — real GPU high-water still unmeasured (known gap; weights ≈ model file size + KV cache is the working proxy until measured).

## Raw run log

- **2026-06-12** · Qwen3-0.6B-ONNX · q4f16 · prompt "The capital of France is" (ChatML, /no_think) · max 48 → `"France is Paris."` · coherent ✅ · 4 tok / 0.46 s (too short for reliable tok/s) · cold load 30.4 s · the decisive T0 correctness data point.
- **2026-06-12** · Qwen3-0.6B-ONNX · q4f16 · prompt "Write a short paragraph explaining why the sky is blue." · max 96 → coherent 70-tok paragraph · **48.2 tok/s** · gen 1.45 s · cold load 28 s · TTFT ⚠0 (probe bug, since fixed).
- **2026-06-12** · Qwen3-0.6B-ONNX · q4f16 · same prompt · max 96 (after TTFT fix) → coherent · **50.6 tok/s** · **TTFT 0.20 s** · cold load ~40 s. TTFT probe validated (skip the prompt `put`).
- **2026-06-12** · Qwen3-1.7B-ONNX · q4f16 (1.33 GB embedded) · **FAIL — `Can't create a session … std::bad_alloc`** at session creation, both as 4th model in a session AND as the first model in a fresh renderer. → the wasm load wall (see section above). dtype-switch won't help (all 1.7B variants ≥1.33 GB).
- **2026-06-12** · memory probe (fresh renderer): cumulative ArrayBuffers 0.5+1+1.33+1.5 GB = 4.33 GB OK; single 2 GB → `RangeError`; `jsHeapSizeLimit` 4 GB; `deviceMemory` 8. → renderer/GPU not the bottleneck; wasm heap is.
